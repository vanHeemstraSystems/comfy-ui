We change the model to **Dream-Shaper-8.safetensors** by clicking on the arrows inside of our new Node **Load Checkpoint**.

Zoom out a bit so you have enough space for adding more nodes. Next, click on the yellow dot next to **Clip** on the **Load Checkpoint** Node and drag it to the right and let go. A new Clip Dialogue pops up. Select **ClipTextEncode** as this will contain our Prompt soon.
